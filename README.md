# Hospital-Management

In a hospital management system using MySQL, the database would be used to store and retrieve information about patients, including their personal and medical history, test results, and treatment plans. The database could also be used to track staff information, such as employee names, roles, and schedules, as well as to schedule appointments and manage resources such as beds and equipment.
